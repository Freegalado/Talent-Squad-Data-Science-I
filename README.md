# Talent-Squad-Data-Science-I

----------------------------------------

## Space X 

The purpose of this project is to develop a model that is able to determine the state that a SpaceX rocket will have from the vibrations measured by different sensors for cost reduction.



---

## Dataset variables: 

Features: The dataset contains 6 features in 6 columns, which are the measured parameters of the different sensors. These correspond to the vibrations detected in the rocket.

Target: The target corresponds to the label that classifies the types of states of the rocket according to the features measured by the sensors.

    - Target 0 : Stable
    - Target 1 : Light Turbulence
    - Target 2 : Moderate Turbulence
    - Target 3 : Severe Turbulence
    - Target 4 : Extreme Turbulence
